# Game of Life

## How to start:
Open 'ui.html' in a web browser. 

## Rules of game of life:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## How to play:
There is a grid of cells displayed on your screen. The color fill of the cell
indicates whether the cell is alive (black) or dead (white). By clicking on
a particular cell you can change its current state. Once you are happy with 
the grid state you established, you can start the game by clicking the button
'Start' which will loop the game (apply the rules of game of life periodically) OR
alternatively you can play the game one step at a time by clickin on the 'Step' button.
If you have chosen to loop the game, you can pause at any given time by clicking the
respective button.
